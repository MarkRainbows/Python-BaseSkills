Almost heaven
West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River
Life is old there
Older than the trees
Younger than the mountains
Growing like a breeze
Country road(s) take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia
Mountain Mommaã€€
Take me home country road(s)
All my memories gather round her
Miner's Lady
Stranger to red water
Dark and dusty
Painted on the sky
Misty taste of moon shine
Tear drops in my eyes
Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia
Mountain Momma
Take me home country road(s)
I hear her voice in the morning hours
She calls me
The radio reminds me of my home
Far away
And driving down the road
I get a feeling that I should have been home yesterday
Yesterday
Country road(s) take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia
Mountain Momma
